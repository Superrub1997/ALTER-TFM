<h1>ARGDSL</h1>
This is a declarative, textual DSL that allows customising all aspects of an AR game, including the domain elements, their graphical representation, their behaviour and the game logic. The goal of ARGDSL is to avoid the need of programming or the use of complex AR frameworks, lowering the entry barrier to AR game development. Currently, we focus on physically realistic skill games (e.g., labyrinths, balance games, shooters)..
